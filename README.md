# {Hello algorithms-community} 

Welcome to the Repo to hold all things related to our algorithms community! 

Begining in early 2017 we will have a monthly meetup for our members to get together and work developing their problem solving skills by collectively tacking algorithms and data structures problems! 

All levels are welcome! 

## This month's challenges:
* [Boo-lean logic](https://github.com/womenwhocoderichmond/algorithms-community/blob/master/boo-lean_logic.md)

## Resources:
* [Past Algorithms Challenges](https://github.com/womenwhocoderichmond/algorithms-community/blob/master/past_challenges.md)
* [Quantum What?!](https://github.com/womenwhocoderichmond/algorithms-community/blob/master/quantum.md)
